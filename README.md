# T0-DO-LIST-APP </br> </br>

A straightforward, user-friendly tool for managing everyday chores is the To-Do List App. Users can mark tasks as completed and create, amend, and delete tasks. The application's UI is created utilizing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI for style. Users' tasks are preserved even when the page is reloaded thanks to task data that is stored in the browser's local storage.   </br> </br>
